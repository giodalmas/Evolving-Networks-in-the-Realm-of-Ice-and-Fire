A comparative Network Analysis of “Game of Thrones” Book One and Five.

This project embarks on a journey through the intricate web of relationships in George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series, "Game of Thrones". Utilizing the power of network science, we delve into the complex character interactions, comparing the networks formed in the first book, "A Game of Thrones", with those in the fifth and last book, "A Dance with Dragons".

The analysis employs a range of network analysis techniques to uncover the evolution of the network structure and the shifting importance and roles of characters over the course of the narrative.
